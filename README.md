# Agent-Based Modeling
My personal notes and projects from the [Introduction to Agent-Based Modeling class](https://www.complexityexplorer.org/courses/121-introduction-to-agent-based-modeling) offered online through the [Sante Fe Institute](https://santafe.edu).

## Unit 4
### BehaviorSpace
A built-in tool within NetLogo to allow repeated runs over a range of parameter inputs.
It can be run headless to improve speed.
The instructor shows how to analyze the data output from BehaviorSpace in R. There's not a lot of context or lead up to this R section.
